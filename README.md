# GeoWeather Informations
GeoWeather is a WIP Android App (even if there are Releases right now. Because a new System is on the Way) so yeah. You can add Multiple Cities and look at the Weather. This App was inspired by MeteoSwiss a Swiss-Only Weather App.

Planned Features are: 
> More Weather Features like 5-Day Weather Forecast, showing Weather Icons, Hourly Weather Forecast and adding Multiple API's for a better Weather Forecast.
